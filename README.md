# digital-logic-design
All material in this repo will cover the VHDL and CAD tools.  Additional topics will include Boolean algebra, combinational logic circuits, minimization techniques, AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR gates, implementation of sequential circuits, and synthesis techniques of logic circuits using VHDL.  The following will contain gates and digital systems such as a simple processor.
