# seven segment display

the objective of this program is to use VHDL to create a useful component and implement it on an FPGA chip.

The software suite that will be used is the XILINX Vivado software to implement the generic 7-segment output component and use it to display hexadecimal numbers as output for a 4-bit binary input.  

The driver will have the ability to take a 4-bit binary number from the slide switches and display its value in hexadecimal form which will be from 0 to f on one of the segment displays.

This is what the following output will look like...
